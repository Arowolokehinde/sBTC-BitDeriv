# sBTC-BitDeriv - Decentralized P2P BTC Options Contract

## Overview

This Clarity smart contract implements a decentralized peer-to-peer options trading protocol on the Stacks blockchain, with internal BTC tracking. It allows users to:

* Deposit and withdraw BTC (simulated via internal balance mapping)
* Create **CALL** or **PUT** options with a BTC notional value
* Buy and exercise options before expiry
* Use a BTC/USD oracle for off-chain price data input

The contract tracks user BTC balances, manages option lifecycles, and ensures secure settlement based on strike prices.

```clarity
{ 
  option-id: uint 
} => {
  creator: principal,
  buyer: (optional principal),
  option-type: uint, ;; 1 = CALL, 2 = PUT
  strike-price: uint,
  premium: uint,
  expiry: uint,
  btc-amount: uint,
  is-active: bool,
  is-executed: bool,
  creation-height: uint
}
```

### `UserOptions`

Stores created and purchased option IDs per user.

```clarity
{ user: principal } => { created: (list 20 uint), purchased: (list 20 uint) }
```
